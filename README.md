# WoodenTangramPuzzle 2
This game is a further development of the original project. In contrast, this project is based on Open GL ES 2 and takes full advantage of OOP capabilities.
This game was created on the basis of an old Soviet puzzle game. 
During the development process, at the same time, it was found the original name of this kind of puzzles is tangram.
This is an ancient Chinese puzzle consisting of seven flat polygons, called tans, which are put together to form shapes. 
The objective is to replicate a pattern (given only an outline) generally found in a puzzle book using all seven pieces without overlap.
